Ensure your `config.js` is correctly set up with all necessary parameters. Here's a sample configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    token: 'YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN',
    allowedRoleId: 'ROLE_ID_ALLOWED_TO_START_GAME',
    startTime: 30000, // 30 seconds
    maxPlayers: 20,
    minPlayers: 6,
